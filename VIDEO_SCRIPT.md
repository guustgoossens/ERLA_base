# ERLA Demo Video Script (REVISED)
**Duration: 3 minutes max**
**Format: Two-person demo with live + high-speed replay**

---

## OPENING - LAUNCH LIVE QUERY (0:00 - 0:30)

**Person 1** (on camera, enthusiastic):
> "What if AI could explore scientific literature the way researchers actually think—following leads, spawning parallel investigations, and validating every claim?"

**Person 2**:
> "That's ERLA—Exploratory Recursive Language Agents. Watch this."

**Person 1** (screen: terminal):
> "We're going to search for 'machine learning based alpha generation.' and let ERLA explore."

*[Type and run command]*

```bash
python run_research_live.py "quantum error correction in topological qubits" --iterations 5
```

**Person 2** (screen: web app, session appears in list):
> "There it goes—launching the first Scout. This will take a few minutes, so whilst that runs..."

*[Click to different view]*

**Person 1**:
> "...let me show you what happens when it's done."

---

## HIGH-SPEED REPLAY - ARCHITECTURE (0:30 - 1:00)

**Person 2** (screen: premade session #1, starting replay at 2-3x speed):
> "This is a completed session on transformer attention mechanisms. I'm playing it back at high speed."

*[Graph builds rapidly - branches appear, papers populate]*

**Person 1**:
> "Each large sphere is a Scout—an autonomous research unit that searches papers, summarises them, and validates every word."

**Person 2** (graph continues building):
> "The Captain validates each summary through a 3-stage pipeline: fact-check classifier, token-level detection, and NLI verification."

**Person 1**:
> "Only summaries achieving 95% groundedness pass through. Watch—"

*[Point to papers appearing with different colours]*

**Person 2**:
> "Green papers passed. Yellow are borderline. Red failed validation—they never make it into the knowledge base."

---

## HIGH-SPEED REPLAY - RECURSION (1:00 - 1:40)

**Person 1** (graph shows branch splitting):
> "Here's the magic. When a Scout's context window hits 80%..."

*[Branch splits, two child branches appear]*

**Person 2**:
> "The Master Agent spawns child Scouts. Same knowledge, different directions."

**Person 1** (zoom to show branch relationships):
> "This one's exploring 'multi-head attention,' this one's investigating 'positional encoding.'"

**Person 2**:
> "It's recursive. Each Scout can spawn more Scouts. The research tree grows autonomously."

*[Show multiple branch levels, graph continues building at speed]*

**Person 1**:
> "And every single node—every paper, every summary—is epistemically grounded."

**Person 2** (click hypothesis node with ring):
> "Eventually, Scouts generate hypotheses. These nodes with rings."

---

## HIGH-SPEED REPLAY - VALIDATION IN ACTION (1:40 - 2:10)

**Person 1** (switch to premade session #2, different topic):
> "Let me show you another one. This searched 'federated learning privacy mechanisms.'"

*[Play at high speed, focus on papers and validation]*

**Person 2** (as papers appear):
> "See the colours changing? That's groundedness scoring in real-time."

**Person 1** (click on paper nodes rapidly):
> "95% grounded... 89%... this one's 62%—rejected."

**Person 2** (event feed scrolling fast):
> "Every action is logged. Branch created... papers added... summary validated... hypothesis generated."

**Person 1**:
> "The key innovation? Compartmentalisation. Each Scout maintains its own validated knowledge base."

**Person 2**:
> "Hallucinations can't cascade because validation happens atomically—one summary at a time."

---

## RETURN TO LIVE QUERY (2:10 - 2:50)

**Person 1**:
> "Remember the quantum error correction search we started?"

*[Switch back to live session - shows progress]*

**Person 2**:
> "It's already found papers and validated summaries. Look—"

*[Show live graph with first branch, several papers, event feed updating]*

**Person 1** (reading stats):
> "One Scout running, 12 papers found, 8 summaries validated so far."

**Person 2** (event feed updating in real-time):
> "And it's still going. Papers being added... summaries validating..."

*[Show new event appearing]*

**Person 1** (click on validated paper):
> "This summary—93% grounded. Every token verified against the source."

**Person 2**:
> "Give it five more minutes and it'll spawn child Scouts, generate hypotheses, explore deeper."

---

## CLOSING (2:50 - 3:00)

**Person 1** (zoom out, show both sessions):
> "We shifted from 'better prompting' to maintaining epistemic integrity at every step."

**Person 2**:
> "That's how you let AI explore safely."

**Person 1**:
> "ERLA—letting computers explore again, accurately."

**Person 2**:
> "Code's on GitHub. Run your own research sessions."

## TECHNICAL NOTES FOR FILMING

**Preparation:**
- **Premade sessions (2)**: Select visually rich completed sessions on different topics
  - Session 1: Clear branch splitting, multiple levels, good variety of groundedness
  - Session 2: Different topic, focus on validation (mix of passed/failed papers)
- **Live query**: Choose interesting topic that will get results quickly (12-15 papers in 2-3 min)
- Test replay speed: 2-3x works best for following visually

**Timeline structure:**
1. **0:00-0:30**: Launch live → switch away
2. **0:30-2:10**: Two premade sessions on high speed (40s each)
3. **2:10-2:50**: Return to live showing real progress
4. **2:50-3:00**: Wrap-up

**Screen recordings needed:**
1. Terminal launching live query
2. Session appearing in list (live)
3. Two different premade sessions played at 2-3x speed showing:
   - Branches spawning and splitting
   - Papers appearing with colour coding
   - Event feeds scrolling
   - Hypothesis generation
4. Return to live session showing partial progress
5. Live event feed updating in real-time

**Speaker alternation:**
- Switch speakers every 15-30 seconds during high-speed replays
- Keeps energy high
- Each person gets roughly equal screen time
- Natural back-and-forth maintains pace

**Key visual moments:**
- Live query launching (0:00-0:30) - establishes "this is real"
- First branch split in replay (1:00-1:10) - the "wow" moment
- Colour-coded validation (1:40-2:00) - shows the rigor
- Return to live with actual progress (2:10) - "it actually worked"
- Live event appearing (2:30) - real-time validation

**Camera setup:**
- Picture-in-picture with speakers in corner during screen recordings
- OR split screen during transitions
- Make sure both people visible at key moments (opening, closing, transitions)

**Pacing notes:**
- Opening: energetic, hook them fast
- Replays: keep talking, maintain momentum, high energy
- Return to live: satisfying "reveal" moment
- Closing: land the philosophical point, simple and memorable

**B-roll suggestions:**
- Graph rotating during explanations
- Close-ups of groundedness percentages
- Event feed rapid scrolling
- Branch count incrementing
- Side-by-side comparison of passed vs failed papers
